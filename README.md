# Homework-5

homework was created by requested criteria bellow:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

I started with creating the HTML buttons with proper timeblock from 9M to 5PM, then I added Ids to each button along with class and values to be able to link my script file and get it to behave as requested, I have also used font awesome i class to add an icon to the save button.
